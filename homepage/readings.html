In Laurel Schwulst’s article, she informs about the contents of a website. She talks about how websites shouldn’t be static file folders of work but a tool to enhance the work an artist has already done. She goes on to talk about website creators as authors of their rooms in their world. A website can be whatever someone wants it to be; there are no limitations when it comes to creativity. I’ve also always looked at websites as an advancement of the work I've already created; as a way to experience my work in a fun, immersive way. Additionally, in Jenny Odell’s article, How to Internet, she talks about the internet as a place where people can get lost and where artists can create their worlds. I feel like Laurel and Jenny both preach the diversity and versatility of the internet; whether that be personal websites, social media, or businesses, the cyberspace world is a place for artists to create fantastic worlds that are unique to their style (similarly shown in Molly Soda’s website).

In Lara Baladi’s article, Archiving a Revolution in the Digital Age, Archiving as an Act of Resistance, she takes the reader through the development of media as an asset for capturing moments in history. Design, art, photography, and social media have become huge platforms of expression and documentation of history through a plethora of lenses. It allows people to capture their stories and share their suffering, protest, activism, and knowledge with the global community. However, because of the constant stream of new information that floods feed every second, Paul Soulellis talks briefly about pausing the explore page. I find it interesting the idea of printing out works of media to momentarily pause history and analyze its impact on society or problems at large. Because of these early acts of mediatizing protests and historical moments, the mass media has developed this reputation of documentation that reaches people beyond those living the experience. It gives people the opportunity to hear those untold stories of suffrage and protest and the loud calls for activism, even from halfway across the world.

In the video, the topic of what the internet was and where it came from was discussed. I especially found interest in the gender imbalance of the coding and computer industry and the lack of female representation in these fields. Additionally, realizing that the internet is not a place that should be run by a few large corporations but by individual people all contribute to the vast spread of information. The internet is full of unlimited connections and information that if a few large companies took over the freedom to explore would be extremely limited. It thrives off of the millions of individuals’ websites that create new connections in the cloud for the internet to be sustainable.

In her Tedx Talk “I steal DNA from strangers”, Heather Dewey-Hagborg discusses how DNA that we unintentionally leave behind can hold an abundance of vulnerable information about who we are. Her artwork of strangers, digitally created through the processing of their DNA, brings awareness to the uncommon topic of study - biological surveillance - and if corporations and the government have the power to extract our private information from DNA we leave it behind. Lauren McCarthy’s talks more about the personal connection with surveillance in our private lives and homes. Her work critiques the AI that is put into Google Homes or Amazon Alexas, and how it feels to give AI this power in our homes. She replaces the AI with a real person to pose the question of whether a real human being could understand you better than an AI because of the “real” life connection? She realizes the weird interaction and language barriers that arise when the human-to-human interaction is presented. 
In Lauren McCarthy’s work, she poses the question about the people who don’t have the privilege of hiding. Who’s to determine this? Is it the status you hold online? And how do we protect their privacy? 
In a world where surveillance has expanded beyond our phones, how do we ensure the privacy of our information? Is becoming “invisible” biologically enough if our technology is tracking our likes, tweets, and purchases?

In An Xiao Mina’s talk, she discusses the impact of the internet on modern politics. Due to the widespread of memes being shared, remixed, and circulated across social media platforms, they are used as important tools for spreading awareness and information on a larger, more global scale. She also talks about their acceptance into social movements and that their constant change allows them to be remixed through the lens of different narratives. 
Hito Steyerl talks about the symbolism of ‘poor images’ and how they affect reality. Since images can come in many different forms, JPEG, photographs, series of moving images, in conjunction with high-resolution images and more bright, impressive images, Steyerl argues that “imperfect Cinema” can be just as effective as their cleaner counterparts. Because of the blur and imperfections, it can merge the division of labor within the social class for example, and create new distinctions between audience and author.

In Joy Buolamwini’s TEDx talk titled “How I’m fighting bias in algorithms”, she talks about her drive to fight the biases displayed through machine learning; a phenomenon she likes to call “coded gaze”. She conducted a facial recognition project and discovered that it didn’t recognize her face (she has a darker complexion) because the people who originally coded the algorithm taught it only a narrow range of skin tones and facial features. As she presents, algorithms and machine learning are taking over every aspect of our lives and with her work, she hopes to keep coders and algorithmic programmers accountable. 
In Mimi Onuoha’s talk at the Eyeo convention in 2017, she talks about her passion for data; however, she was not talking about the data itself but the process in which the data is collected. She talks about the differences between categorization and collection in data analysis through her work of following 4 Londoners for a month. Her work focuses on how we as people have been abstracted, represented, classified, and forgotten in the world of data. 
In “Afro-now-ism”, Stephanie Dinkins talks about the process of reconstructing the idea of the human. The idea of using algorithms and data to reimagine human supremacy. She also talks about how we much reconstruct and evaluate the violence that we have enacted on one another to create a sustainable coexistence among species and computational machines. How we need to learn to merge intelligence and technology about the human experience. And additionally, with the emergence of AI and machine learning into all aspects of society, and understand its benefits and harms. 
In her Tedx Talk, Joy proposes, in the end, a project of volunteering one’s face for machine learning. How does this play hand in hand with the surveillance of humans? How do we know that our personal information isn’t being thrown into the hands of the wrong people even after being used for algorithmic purposes? And would you do it? 
How do we balance the recognition of the process behind the data and the data itself in data analysis? If we focus too much on the process do we lose the data in the process? 
In regards to Stephanie Dinkins’s article, how do we reimagine the idea of the human without bias?

Morehshin Allahyari talks about the use of digital technologies and activism, digital colonialism, the differences between physical bans against toys, and re-figuring as it relates to the process of making her project called Material Speculation: ISIS and its Aftermath. She discusses the normalization of this censorship that goes unseen and encourages her audiences to better understand online censorship. Yaa Addae talks about the influence of data healing and trauma on the growing impact of the internet on society. She also encourages the continuous editing of our social media and “alternative metrics of engagement on social media”. Olivia McKayla Ross goes into the use of p5.js and its impact on the digital world and technology (for this was her first step into the coding world). Olivia McKayla Ross explains the importance of how we honor and appreciate certain groups and people in alignment with their connection to technology. 
How do we effectively use our online platform to honor different communities? 
To what extent is our engagement with social media adding to the data trauma? 
How much does online censorship control our daily lives?

In Tate Ryan-Mosley and Jennifer Strong’s article, they talk about Hamid Khan and his fight for the abolition of surveillance. In the interview, Hamid talks about how technology and surveillance enable racism in policing more. He speaks against the idea of reforms and how eventually we always come back to where we ended off and nothing gets changed. In Ari Melenciano’s talk, she discussed how design can be re-imagined to be sustainable interdisciplinary, and biomimicratic but embracing history and justice. Additionally, she encourages that design needs to stray away from more human-center work to more ecologically-center work. Audre Lorde talks about the lack of different female perspectives represented at a conference she was asked to speak at. She advocates that “difference must be not merely tolerated, but seen as a fund of necessary polarities between which our creativity can spark like a dialectic”. 
When does surveillance cross the line of protection, especially in regards to Hamid Khan’s work? How can we authentically celebrate our differences as women?

This piece titled “Where We Go From Here” is a multi-disciplinary collection of three of Delta Ark’s works. All three of the architectural line sculptures examine, in some aspect, income inequality, eviction/displacement, and technology/media. I especially was captivated by this piece because of how interesting “hallow” art can take physical form and feeling like solid works. This idea that simple lines can take up so much solid space and make views feel like their in a closed structure when in reality you can walk straight through it.
