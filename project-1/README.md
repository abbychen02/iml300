[OVERREACTING](http://abbychen02.github.io/iml300/index.html) is a non-linear narrative following the choice by choice decisions when experiencing an anxiety attack.


### Description

OVERREACTING is a non-linear narrative that contains content that relays themes of anxiety.. It is the visualization of a panic attack and mimics the fast paced decision making that many people must go through. In our global moment, many people all over the world are experiencing different forms of anxiety. I, for one, have been constantly anxious about what will happen next in our unforgiving world. Through a “choose your own adventure” style narrative, I allow the reader to click through their own regular day and understand that anxiety it’s a taboo topic and consumes people’s lives. This piece is meant to create urgency and fear when being played and forces the reader to make fast decisions with no recollection of what is to happen next. Anxiety attacks are unpredictable making quick decision making, like mimicked in OVERREACHING, so crucial to someone’s survival.
